# terraform-gh-modules

## Welcome to the GitHub Terraform Modules repository!

This repository contains Terraform modules for managing GitHub. The modules are designed to be used in a standalone fashion or as part of a larger deployment.

The inspiration for this repository came from the [terraform-aws-modules](github.com/terraform-aws-modules) repository, which provides a collection of Terraform modules for deploying AWS resources.
